      -Note 1: This was a short, 4-day course designed to give users an introduction to using 3D Slicer/SlicerMorph. I highly recommend going through each module they have listed and follow along. If you already have segmentations, and are interested in only landmarking, then skip those models. 
      -Note 2: If you are importing from a different segmentation software, it is recommended you shrinkwrap your models before performing any cloud-point based registration techniques like ALPACA/MALPACA to perform landmarking. Models that possess open facets will have their interior architecture captured.
